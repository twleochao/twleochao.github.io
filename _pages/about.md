I'm Leo, a senior at **University of California, Irvine** majoring in Computer Science with a specialization in Intelligent Systems. 

My research interests and work lies at the intersection between **Artificial Intelligence and Human Agency**. While modern generative tools are powerful, they often lack precise control and reliability for complex workflows. I'm passionate about bridging the gap between powerful generative tools and real-world usability.

Whether it's through researching cognitive offloading on LLMs (at **ARACLA LAB**) or building multi-agent software development assistants (at **Acer**), my goal is to develop tools that empower rather than replace humans. 

## Leadership & Community 

Beyond academia and technical work, I'm involved in various communities that focus on education and culture as I believe software systems are most effective when they're built with empathy for the user.

I founded the **Taiwanese Programming Outreach Association (TPOA)**, where we partnered with the Education Bureau to bring digital literacy to rural Taiwan, integrating CS curriculums into 10+ local schools. At UCI, I continued with my focus on community building as part of the **Taiwanese Student Association**, managing resources for 20+ events annually.

## Beyond the Lab

When I'm not in the lab or school, I also enjoy a variety of other more creative and physical activities, which I find myself occasionally discovering subtle intersections with the technicality of my work.

I've been playing classical piano since I was a kid, I find the discipline to practice transfers well into programming. If you're not familiar with classical music, **[here's](/piano/)** a list of some of my favorite pieces and recordings of all time.

I also enjoying the intricacies of various <span class="hover-reveal">origami<span class="hidden-content"><img src="/assets/images/crane-logo.png" alt="Origami Crane">a ~1cm^3 paper crane I made (this is the inspiration for the site's theme)</span></span> designs. My other interests include pour-over coffee, poker, and skiing, all of which reveal a different complex part of the physical world to me.
