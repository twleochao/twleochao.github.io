I'm Leo, currently a 3rd year (senior standing) at University of California, Irvine studying Computer Science with a specialization in Intelligent Systems. 

My research interests and work lies at the intersection between Artificial Intelligence and human control.  Specifically, I'm passionate about understanding and bridging the gap between powerful generative tools and real-world usability.

Whether it's through researching cognitive offloading on LLMs (at **ARACLA LAB**) or building multi-agent software development assistants (at **Acer**), my goal is to develop tools that empower and rather than replace humans. 

## Leadership & Initiatives

Beyond technical research, I'm involved in various communities that focus on education and culture as I believe software systems are most effective when they're built with empathy for the user.

### Taiwanese Proramming Outreach Association (TPOA)
Founder & Program Director - I founded TPOA to bring digital knowledge to rural areas of Taiwan. We worked with 10+ public schools and the Education Bureau to integrate programming and software knowledge into their cirruculums.

### Taiwanese Student Association
Treasurer & Board Member - At UCI, I helped run the biggest Taiwanese cultural organization on campus. I managed the budget for our events etc..

## Beyond the Lab

When I'm not in the lab or school, I like to enjoy a variety of other more creative and physical activities, they often reveal subtle ways intersections with the technicality of my work.

I've been playing classical piano since I was a kid, here's a top 10 list of my favorite recordings. I'm also fond of origami (this is the inspiration for the crane motif). I also enjoy pour-over coffee, figuring out the game theory of poker, and skiing.
