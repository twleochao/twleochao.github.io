I'm Leo, a senior at **University of California, Irvine** majoring in Computer Science with a specialization in Intelligent Systems. 

My research interests and work lie at the intersection between **Artificial Intelligence and Human Agency**. While modern generative tools are powerful, they often lack precise control and reliability for complex workflows. I'm passionate about bridging the gap between powerful generative tools and real-world usability.

Whether it's through researching cognitive offloading on LLMs (at **ARACLA LAB**) or building multi-agent software development assistants (at **Acer**), my goal is to develop tools that empower rather than replace humans. 

## Leadership & Community 

Beyond work and academia, I'm also involved in cultural and educational communities. I believe software systems are most effective when built with empathy for the user.

I founded the **Taiwanese Programming Outreach Association (TPOA)**, where we partnered with the Education Bureau to bring digital literacy to rural Taiwan, integrating CS curriculums into 10+ local schools. At UCI, I continued this focus on community building with the **Taiwanese Student Association**, managing resources for over 20 annually.

## Beyond the Lab

When I'm not in the lab or school, I also enjoy a variety of other more creative and physical activities that often subtly intersect with the technicality of my work.

I've been playing classical piano since I was a kid. I find the discipline to practice transfers well into programming. If you're not familiar with classical music, **[here](/piano/)** is a list of some of my favorite pieces and recordings of all time.

I also enjoying the intricacies of various <span class="hover-reveal">origami<span class="hidden-content"><img src="/assets/images/tinycrane.jpg" alt="Origami Crane">a ~1cm^3 paper crane I made (this is the inspiration for the site's theme)</span></span> designs. My other interests include pour-over coffee, poker, and skiing, all of which demand their own distinct blend of precision, logic, and intuition.
