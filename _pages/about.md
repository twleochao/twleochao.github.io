Hi! I'm Leo, currently a 3rd year (senior standing) at University of California, Irvine studying Computer Science with a specialization in Intelligent Systems. 

My research interests are Machine Learning systems, Large Language Models evaluation & tooling, assistive & real-time systems, and Human-Computer-Interaction for learning.
Specifically, I'm very passionate about developing co-working systems that utilize AI for real-world applications.

Currently, I'm a researcher at UCI's ARCALA Lab. Previously, I was a SWE intern at Acer, where I worked on developing a Multi-Agent-System for automating the Sofware Development Life Cycle. Learn more about our research and my other projects from the project page.

## Leadership & Initiatives

Beyond technical research, I'm involved in various communities that focus on education and culture.
